# ================  Plotting networks with igraph ================

 
#  ------->> Plot parameters in igraph --------

# We can set the node & edge options in two ways - one is to specify
# them in the plot() function, as we are doing below.

# Plot with curved edges (edge.curved=.1) and reduce arrow size:
plot(net, edge.arrow.size=.4, edge.curved=.1)

# Set node color to orange and the border color to hex #555555
# Replace the vertex label with the node names stored in "media"
plot(net, edge.arrow.size=.2, edge.curved=0,
     vertex.color="orange", vertex.frame.color="#555555",
     vertex.label=V(net)$media, vertex.label.color="black",
     vertex.label.cex=.7) 

# The second way to set attributes is to add them to the igraph object.

# Generate colors based on media type:
colrs <- c("gray50", "tomato", "gold")
V(net)$color <- colrs[V(net)$media.type]

# Set node size based on audience size:
V(net)$size <- V(net)$audience.size*0.7

# The labels are currently node IDs.
# Setting them to NA will render no labels:
V(net)$label.color <- "black"
V(net)$label <- NA

# Set edge width based on weight:
E(net)$width <- E(net)$weight/6

#change arrow size and edge color:
E(net)$arrow.size <- .2
E(net)$edge.color <- "gray80"

plot(net) 

# We can also override the attributes explicitly in the plot:
plot(net, edge.color="orange", vertex.color="gray50") 


# We can also add a legend explaining the meaning of the colors we used:
plot(net) 
legend(x=-1.1, y=-1.1, c("Newspaper","Television", "Online News"), pch=21,
       col="#777777", pt.bg=colrs, pt.cex=2.5, bty="n", ncol=1)


# Sometimes, especially with semantic networks, we may be interested in 
# plotting only the labels of the nodes:

plot(net, vertex.shape="none", vertex.label=V(net)$media, 
     vertex.label.font=2, vertex.label.color="gray40",
     vertex.label.cex=.7, edge.color="gray85")


# Let's color the edges of the graph based on their source node color.
# We'll get the starting node for each edge with "ends()".
edge.start <- ends(net, es=E(net), names=F)[,1]
edge.col <- V(net)$color[edge.start]

plot(net, edge.color=edge.col, edge.curved=.1)


# ------->> Improving network plots --------

plot(net)

# Notice that this network plot is still not too helpful.
# We can identify the type and size of nodes, but cannot see
# much about the structure since the links we're examining are so dense.
# One way to approach this is to see if we can sparsify the network.

hist(links$weight)
mean(links$weight)
sd(links$weight)

# There are more sophisticated ways to extract the key edges,
# but for the purposes of this excercise we'll only keep ones
# that have weight higher than the mean for the network.

# We can delete edges using delete_edges(net, edges)
cut.off <- mean(links$weight) 
net.sp <- delete_edges(net, E(net)[weight<cut.off])
plot(net.sp) 

# Another way to think about this is to plot the two tie types 
# (hyperlik & mention) separately:

E(net)$width <- 2
plot(net, edge.color=c("dark red", "slategrey")[(E(net)$type=="hyperlink")+1],
      vertex.color="gray40", layout=layout_in_circle)

# Another way to delete edges:  
net.m <- net - E(net)[E(net)$type=="hyperlink"]
net.h <- net - E(net)[E(net)$type=="mention"]

# Plot the two links separately:
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

plot(net.h, vertex.color="orange", main="Tie: Hyperlink")
plot(net.m, vertex.color="lightsteelblue2", main="Tie: Mention")

# Heatmap of the network matrix:

# ================  Assortativity and Homophily ================

# Assortativity (homophily)
# The tendency of nodes to connect to others who are similar on some variable.
# assortativity_nominal() is for categorical variables (labels)
# assortativity() is for ordinal and above variables
# assortativity_degree() checks assortativity in node degrees
